I'm applying for the Mozilla Science Fellows program because it will provide training and foster collaboration at the intersection of three of my passions: open science, cognitive science, and data science.

The Mozilla Science team wants to work with champions of open science, and I believe the first step to becoming a champion is to be a practicing open scientist. As an open scientist, I conduct my research using open source tools, and make everything about my research, including the experiment, data, and analyses, accessible and available online from the start of the research.

My interest in open science began with concerns about the replicability of research in my field, cognitive science. It seemed clear to me that openness in all aspects of the scientific process is the cure. Openness purifies research by making it more reproducible, more replicable, and more reuseable.

Adopting open practices in my own work has made it better, but it hasn't always been easy. Real research is messy. In a recently accepted paper we include the results of a self-administered replication effort where we didn't replicate the original effect. In pulling our hair out trying to figure out why, we discovered problems in the original design, so we fixed them and ran the experiment again. By being open in our research practices, we improved the experiment. Open science is better science.

Another big part of open science is helping out other scientists, and I believe that code is the most valuable information we can share with one another. But we can do better; we can share what we know more effectively than we do. As a Mozilla Science Fellow, I want to learn what needs to improve and how to improve it from the people that know how to make openness work. One idea I have is to teach open scientists the collaborative practices invented in the open source community as a way to promote productive collaboration via code.

The main reason I think I would make a good champion for open science is that I believe in the power of open collaboration. Open source software changed the digital world. Open encyclopedia writing created the world's largest and arguably best encyclopedia. In my research on cultural evolution and the evolution of cultural products, I'm trying to figure out why these open collaborations work and what we can do to make them better. As a Mozilla Science Fellow, I hope to research ways to improve open collaborations, and share those findings with the open science community.
