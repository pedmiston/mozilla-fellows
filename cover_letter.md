I'm applying for the Mozilla Science Fellows program because I think I'd make a good champion for open science. A big part of open science is helping out other scientists, and I believe code is some of the most valuable information we can share with one another, or at least I have benefited greatly from it. My research on the relationship between language and cognition has relied entirely on code written by other open scientists and the open source community[^oss], mostly because I didn't know what I was doing. Now I've been hacking away for long enough that programming has started to get easier and I think I might have learned something others might find helpful. My primary motivation for applying for the Fellows program is to engage in productive collaboration about the ways in which what I know might be able to help the open science community.

In addition to supporting research, open science also supports transparency in the scientific process. My interest in this aspect of open science began with concerns about the replicability of research in my field and others. It seemed clear to me that openness in all aspects of the scientific process is the cure. Openness purifies research by making it more reproducible, more replicable, and more reuseable. Adopting open practices has made my own research better, but it hasn't always been easy. In a paper recently accepted for publication we report the results of a self-administered replication effort, where our original results didn't replicate. In pulling our hair out trying to figure out why, we discovered problems in the original design, fixed them and reran the experiment.

One example of this is the Telephone app I built to conduct experiments on the evolution of language. We had people play a giant game of telephone on the internet, but instead of using a sentence as the first message in each game, we used a sound effect, like gurgling water or breaking glass. 

We wanted to know whether repeating a message over and over changes it _simply as a consequence of being repeated_ [^counter].

Of course, everyone's memory of

[^counter]: The irony of course is that everyone's memory of the children's game of telephone is that the messages were definitely garbled by the end of the line.

Performing research with open source tools and in turn making the products of research avai




[^oss]: I use [psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org/) for running behavioral psychology experiments. I have the open web to thank for allowing me to hack together online experiments. Without R, my figures would be terrible and I wouldn't know statistics. For duct tape I use [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).
