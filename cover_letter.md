A big part of **open science** is helping out other scientists, and I believe code is the most valuable information we can share with one another. I also believe that we can do it better, that we can share what we know more effectively than we do. I'm applying for the Mozilla Science Fellows program because I want to figure out how.

My interest in open science began with concerns about the replicability of research in my field, **cognitive psychology**. It seemed clear to me that openness in all aspects of the scientific process is the cure. Openness purifies research by making it more reproducible, more replicable, and more reuseable. Adopting open practices in my own research has made it better. In a recently accepted paper we include the results of a self-administered replication effort, where we didn't replicate our original results, and we had to figure out why. Eventually we discovered problems in the original design, fixed them and reran the experiment. The result of open science is better science.

My research and the desire to be an open scientist required that I learn to program, and soon I became attached to the **data science** label. To me, a data scientist is just a scientist who tries to automate and document everything about her research with code. Data science is above all else reproducible science. The aspect of data science I care most about is writing code that other people can use and learn from, which is why I enjoy giving lectures and tutorials on data science topics.


[^oss]: All of my research is conducted using open source software. I use [psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org/) for running behavioral psychology experiments. I have the open web to thank for allowing me to hack together online experiments. Without R, my figures would be terrible and I wouldn't know statistics. For research duct tape, I use [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).
