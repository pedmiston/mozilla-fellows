A big part of **open science** is helping out other scientists, and I believe code is the most valuable information we can share with one another. I also believe that we can do it better, that we can share what we know more effectively than we do. I'm applying for the Mozilla Science Fellows program because I want to figure out what we need to do to improve and how to do it.

My interest in open science began with concerns about the replicability of research in my field, **cognitive science**. It seemed clear to me that openness in all aspects of the scientific process is the cure. Openness purifies research by making it more reproducible, more replicable, and more reuseable. Adopting open practices in my own research has made it better, but it hasn't always been easy. In a recently accepted paper we included the results of a self-administered replication effort, where we didn't replicate our original results, and we had to figure out why. Eventually we discovered problems in the original design, fixed them and reran the experiment. The result of open science is better science.

My research and the desire to be an open scientist required that I learn to program, and as a result I've become attached to the **data science** label. To me, a data scientist is someone who documents their research with code. The aspect of data science I care most about is writing code that other people can use and learn from, which is why I enjoy giving lectures and tutorials on data science topics.

The main reason I think I would make a good champion for open science is that I believe in the power of open collaboration. Open source software changed the digital world. Open encyclopedia writing created the world's largest and arguably best encyclopedia. In my research on cultural evolution and the evolution of cultural products, I'm trying to figure out why these open collaborations work and what we can do to make them better. As a Mozilla Science Fellow, I hope to research ways to improve open collaborations, and share those findings with the open science community.
