## Technical skills

### Python

I use python for everything from running in-person behavioral experiments using [**psychopy**](http://www.psychopy.org/) to building web-based experiments with Django, to lots (and lots) of data munging with **pandas**.

### R

I use R for data visualization and regression modeling, including hierarchical linear regression using the `lme4` package. I use a lot of the packages in the Hadleyverse, primarily `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.

### Command line

I spend all day at the command line, mostly for version control and package managers. Automate everything.

### Plaintext

I write papers and presentations in markdown and use pandoc whenever I can. I know how to use Sphinx for literate source code documentation. `knitr` is an amazing tool.

## Current projects

### Wikipedia

### Telephone
