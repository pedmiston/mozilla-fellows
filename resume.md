## Education

I'm currently working on a PhD in the Psychology Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

- Concentration in Cognitive and Cognitive Neuroscience.
- Advised by Dr. Gary Lupyan.

I received a Master of Science in the same department in 2013.

- Thesis work was eventually published as "What makes words special? Words as unmotivated cues" (Edmiston & Lupyan, 2015).
- My actual masters thesis had a worse title, "Comparing cues to the same concept: A difference in motivation".

I received a Bachelor of Arts in an Individualized Major (Cognitive Science) from St. John's University in Collegeville, MN.

- Graduated _summa cum laude_.
- Co-advised by Dr. Ben Faber (Psychology) and Dr. Emily Esch (Philosophy).

## Published research

- We found that visual distraction makes it harder to think about what things look like, but not to think about their nonvisual properties.
- Each experiment is available as a git repository[^orientation][^property], including code used to run the experiment, the raw data, and our analyses.
- In the second experiment, we also report the results of a self-administered replication effort. It wasn't fun.

- People played a giant game of telephone online to test a hypothesis about the evolution of language.
- My conference talk was the topic of a brief online article[^article].
- Several repos are available, for constructing the web app[^django], deploying the infrastructure[^ansible], and conducting the analyses[^pilot][^current].

- If you are ever interested in the ways dog barks differ from words like "dog", this is the paper for you.

## Technical skills

I use **python** for running in-person behavioral experiments with **psychopy**, building web apps with **Django** to run experiments online, and performing lots (and lots) of data scripting and pipelining with **pandas**.

I use **R** for data visualization and regression modeling, including hierarchical linear regression using the **lme4** package. I've given talks at the local R users group on hierarchical linear modeling[^linear] and am giving one soon on design patterns for data science projects[^design]. I use a lot of the packages in the Hadleyverse, primarily **ggplot2** and **dplyr**.

I work best at the **command line**, and I embrace the Unix philosophy that programs should do one thing well. I also write a lot in **plaintext**, and use tools like **pandoc**, **knitr**, and **Sphinx** for creating dynamic documents.
