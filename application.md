# What is your research focus?

I study cultural evolution, specifically the evolution of cultural products like language. Why is language adaptive and what does it afford that nonverbal means of communication do not? Right now I'm studying how the products of human collaboration (e.g., Wikipedia articles) evolve over time.

# Describe to us your current research team.

I work primarily with Dr. Gary Lupyan in his lab in the Psychology Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The [Telephone project](http://github.com/lupyanlab/telephone-app) is in collaboration with Dr. Marcus Perlman. The lab runs behavioral experiments in person and online, exploring various aspects of the relationship between language and cognition.

# Describe to us how open science advances your research.

Open science makes my own research better: more reproducible, more replicable, and more reuseable. Open science is critical for scientific progress in the digital world, where research methods inevitably involve computers. In it's simplest form, I believe open science is the ability to automate the running of an experiment and drawing conclusions from the data with code. Code is the best way scientists have of helping each other out. Writing and sharing code is necessary, but not sufficient for open science, the remaining piece being the attitude that engaging in open science is the best way to discover truth.

# Are you leading any projects related to open science?

I'm interested in what makes open communities work, and one specific hypothesis I have is that a version control system is helpful in allowing the products of open collaboration to evolve progressively and without central control. For example, I have argued that the success of Wikipedia is in part due to the ability of editors to revert articles to previous versions. As it relates to open scientific collaboration, the most important feature of version control systems may be the ability to split a single project into multiple branches, allowing each to evolve independently and in response to different selection pressures.

# How do you see Mozilla advancing your work?

I want to get better at collaborating both for the sake of my own projects as well as figuring out where my skills would be the most beneficial to the open science community.

# What do you see as the opportunities for impact around open research at your university? Could you leverage this opportunity in a potential project?

Open research for behavioral sciences like psychology involves sharing data, experimental methods, and analysis techniques, largely through documentation and code. I know first hand of the need for students in my program and other behavioral sciences to learn computer programming practices that are common to computer scientists but are not taught in other departments, for example, learning a version control system.

# What do you think needs to change most immediately in scientific research?

It's not enough to make experimental methods and data available for others to use, in addition we should strive to make experimental methods extendable, and open scientists should engage in practices that can be shown to maximize reuse, largely at the hands of automation with code.

# What project in the field do you find most inspiring to further science and the web?

I'm interested in platforms for web based behavioral experiments like VolunteerScience and PsiTurk. These projects afford experiments never before possible involving large scale online interaction and collaboration. We are approaching a science of how the products of human collaboration change as a function of iteration.

# Why is the open web important to you?

I trust the open web because I believe it is engineered for success. In open cultures, progress can come from anyone and in any form.
