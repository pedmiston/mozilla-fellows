# What is your research focus?

I study cultural evolution, specifically the evolution of cultural products like language. Why is language adaptive for humans from a cognitive/behavioral perspective? What does language afford that nonverbal means of communication do not. Language is the bedrock of culture, providing some of the best data we have in studying the evolution of cultural products. Right now Iâ€™m interested in the reliability of collaborative systems like Wikipedia in always yielding success, that is, articles always increasing in quality as a result of collaborative editing.

# Describe to us your current research team.

I work primarily with Dr. Gary Lupyan in his lab in the Psychology Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The [Telephone project](http://github.com/pedmiston/telephone-app) is in collaboration with Marcus Perlman. The lab runs behavioral experiments in person and online, exploring various aspects of the relationship between language and cognition.
