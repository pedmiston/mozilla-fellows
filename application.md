# What is your research focus?

I'm trying to learn something about cultural evolution by using open collaborations (e.g., Wikipedia) as model organisms. I'm interested in separating evolutionary change that is shaped by selection pressures from random change. Do Wikipedia editors select for quality as articles accumulate edits? Can selection guarantee incremental progress in open collaborations?

# Describe to us your current research team.

I work primarily with Dr. Gary Lupyan in his lab in the Psychology Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The [Telephone project](http://github.com/lupyanlab/telephone-app) is in collaboration with Dr. Marcus Perlman. The lab runs behavioral experiments in person and online, exploring various aspects of the relationship between language and cognition.

# Describe to us how open science advances your research.

Open science makes my own research better: more reproducible, more replicable, and more reuseable. Open science is critical for scientific progress in the digital world, where research methods inevitably involve computers. In it's simplest form, I believe open science is the ability to automate the running of an experiment and drawing conclusions from the data with code. Code is the best way scientists have of helping each other out. Writing and sharing code is necessary, but not sufficient for open science, the remaining requirement being the attitude that engaging in open science is the best way to discover truth.

# Are you leading any projects related to open science?

I'm interested in what makes open communities work, and one specific hypothesis I have is that version control systems greatly facilitate the progressive evolution of products produced via open collaboration. For example, I have argued that the success of Wikipedia is in large part due to the ability of editors to revert articles to a previous version. As for open scientific collaboration, the most valuable benefit to using version control may be the ability to split a single project into multiple, parallel branches, allowing each to evolve independently and in response to different selection pressures.

# How do you see Mozilla advancing your work?

I'm a cognitive scientist and I like to code too much, which is only a problem because I'm trained to design and run cognitive psychology experiments, not to write code that other people can read. I need more experience collaborating on coding projects and sharing what I've learned.

# What do you see as the opportunities for impact around open research at your university? Could you leverage this opportunity in a potential project?

I could organize a workshop at the [Discovery Center](https://discovery.wisc.edu/), or for the new cross-disciplinary graduate training program [LUCID](https://lucid.wisc.edu/). I also want to run a "merge-a-thon" at my university or for a local users group meeting. A merge-a-thon is "not a competition but a collaboration across different teams developing in parallel".

# What do you think needs to change most immediately in scientific research?

* Honesty and progress need to be valued more than journal names and citations. My strategy is to walk the walk.
* The print journal model of articles as static needs to be replaced with a more dynamic publication that encourages updates, extensions, and replications.
* Scientists need to pay attention to data visualization researchers, specifically when it comes to depicting uncertainty.
* Scientists need to learn the agile philosophy as a strategy for conducting research in teams.
* Growing a collaboration needs to be seen as more important than being ahead.

# What project in the field do you find most inspiring to further science and the web?

The [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) is a mixing pot for different flavors of open science, and I'm inspired by the possible integrations. In my field, platforms for running web-based experiments like [Volunteer Science](https://volunteerscience.com/) and [PsiTurk](https://psiturk.org/) are on the rise, making it more possible than ever to repeat and extend behavioral research.

# Why is the open web important to you?

The open web evolves, it isn't designed. The open web is guaranteed to adapt, as long as there is a community to support it.
