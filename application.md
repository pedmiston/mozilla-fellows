# What is your research focus?

I study cultural evolution, specifically the evolution of cultural products like language. Why is language adaptive and what does it afford that nonverbal means of communication do not? Right now I am studying the evolution of Wikipedia articles and the mechanisms of open collaboration more broadly.

# Describe to us your current research team.

I work primarily with my advisor Dr. Gary Lupyan. The lab runs behavioral experiments in person and online, exploring various aspects of the relationship between language and cognition. I also work with Dr. Marcus Perlman, UC Merced on questions about language evolution. Most of my research can be done remotely.

# Describe to us how open science advances your research. (100 words)

In it's simplest form, open science is open source. By conducting my research in open source code, my research is more reproducible, more replicable, and more reuseable. Open source allows me to do my research. I can run experiments in-person and online, analyze results using state-of-the-art statistics, and visualize the data all for free. Open source also made me a programmer. Like many others, I learned to read and write code largely outside of the formal classroom. The fact that a large part of my education was free is astounding to me, and speaks to the potential of open science.

# Are you leading any projects related to open science?

All of my projects relate to open science in that they are open and available for reproduction and extension. I've promoted this aspect of my research by giving tutorials in our department and talks at local user group events. I'm also leading a research project on what makes open communities work. My hypothesis is that iteration is a key mechanism in the success of open collaborations. The idea is that iteration allows the products of collaboration to evolve gradually which may make successful collaborations more likely. Right now I'm studying this among Wikipedia editors; next up is teams of programmers.

# How do you see Mozilla advancing your work?

I'm a cognitive scientist and I like to code too much, which is only a problem because I'm trained to design and run experiments, not to write code that other people can read. I need more experience collaborating on coding projects and finding the best ways to share my work.

# What do you see as the opportunities for impact around open research at your university? Could you leverage this opportunity in a potential project?

I could organize a workshop at the [Discovery Center](https://discovery.wisc.edu/), or for the new cross-disciplinary graduate training program [LUCID](https://lucid.wisc.edu/). I also want to run a "merge-a-thon" at my university or for a local users group meeting. A merge-a-thon is "not a competition but a collaboration across different teams developing in parallel".

# What do you think needs to change most immediately in scientific research?

* Integrity and contribution need to be valued more than publications and citations.
* The print journal model of articles as static snapshots needs to be replaced with a more dynamic publication that encourages updates, extensions, and replications.
* Scientists need to pay attention to data visualization researchers, specifically when it comes to depicting uncertainty.
* Scientists need to learn the agile philosophy as a strategy for conducting research in teams.
* Growing a collaboration needs to be seen as more important than being ahead.
* We could all get a little better at statistics.

# What project in the field do you find most inspiring to further science and the web?

The [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) is a mixing pot for different flavors of open science, and I'm inspired by the possible integrations. In my field, platforms for running web-based experiments like [Volunteer Science](https://volunteerscience.com/) and [PsiTurk](https://psiturk.org/) are on the rise, making it more possible than ever to repeat and extend behavioral research.

# Why is the open web important to you?

The open web evolves, it isn't designed. The open web is guaranteed to adapt, as long as there is a community to support it.
