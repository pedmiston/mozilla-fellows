# What research fields are you in?

cognitive science  
**cognitive psychology**  
data science  
computational social science?  
evolutionary theory

# What is your research focus?

I study cultural evolution, specifically the evolution of cultural products like language. Why is language adaptive and what does it afford that nonverbal means of communication do not? Right now I am studying the evolution of Wikipedia articles and the mechanisms of open collaboration more broadly.

# Describe to us your current research team.

I work primarily with my advisor Dr. Gary Lupyan. The lab runs behavioral experiments in person and online, exploring various aspects of the relationship between language and cognition. I also work with Dr. Marcus Perlman, UC Merced on questions about language evolution. Most of my research is done remotely.

# Describe to us how open science advances your research. (100 words)

Open science is research that is available and accessible, and encourages collaboration. Open science runs on open source tools; these tools make my research possible. I can design experiments, analyze results using state-of-the-art statistics, and visualize the data all for free. Documenting my research using open source code makes it more reproducible, more replicable, and more reuseable. Learning to use open source tools turned me into a programmer, and as a programmer, I have an easier time chasing research questions.

# Are you leading any projects related to open science?

All of my projects relate to open science in that they are open and available for reproduction and extension. I've promoted this aspect of my research by giving tutorials in our department and talks at local user group events. I'm also leading a research project on what makes open collaborations work. My hypothesis is that iteration is a key mechanism in the success of open collaborations. The idea is that iteration allows the products of collaboration to evolve gradually, which may make successful collaborations more likely. Right now I'm studying this among Wikipedia editors; next up is teams of programmers.

# How do you see Mozilla advancing your work?

Mozilla is a great example of successful open collaboration, and I'd like to learn more about what makes Mozilla work by talking to the people that know it best. I hope to come back inspired to run creative experiments involving teams of people collaborating in different ways for my dissertation.

# What do you see as the opportunities for impact around open research at your university? Could you leverage this opportunity in a potential project?

There are a lot of open research events at the [Discovery Center](https://discovery.wisc.edu), a meeting place for researchers and the community, but none of them have featured behavioral research. I'd like to change that. I could partner with [LUCID](https://lucid.wisc.edu), a training program for research on human and machine learning.

# What do you think needs to change most immediately in scientific research?

* The print journal model of articles as static snapshots needs to be replaced with a more dynamic publication that encourages updates, extensions, and replications.
* Scientists need to pay more attention to research in data visualization, specifically when it comes to conveying uncertainty.
* Scientists need to learn the agile philosophy as a strategy for conducting research in teams.
* More scientific progress can be made through collaboration than competition among individual researchers.
* We could all get a little better at statistics.

# What project in the field do you find most inspiring to further science and the web?

I'm inspired by configuration management systems like **ansible** and how they can be used in combination with cloud computing resources to replicate and orchestrate entire research infrastructures anywhere in the world using only plaintext configuration files.

# Why is the open web important to you?

The open web is the future of individualized education, and the only way to maintain individual independence in online cultures.
