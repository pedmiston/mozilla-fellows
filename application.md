wannabe evolutionary biology

# What is your research focus?

I study cultural evolution, specifically the evolution of cultural products like language. Why is language adaptive for humans from a cognitive/behavioral perspective? What does language afford that nonverbal means of communication do not? Language is the bedrock of culture, providing the best data we have to study the evolution of cultural products. Right now I'm studying Wikipedia as a model organism for the study of cultural evolution.

# Describe to us your current research team.

I work primarily with Dr. Gary Lupyan in his lab in the Psychology Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The [Telephone project](http://github.com/lupyanlab/telephone-app) is in collaboration with Dr. Marcus Perlman. The lab runs behavioral experiments in person and online, exploring various aspects of the relationship between language and cognition.

# Describe to us how open science advances your research.

Engaging in open science practices makes my own research better: more
reproducible, more replicable, and more reuseable. Open science is
a fundamental part of scientific progress. In its purest form, I believe open
science is the ability to automate an experiment and the conclusions drawn from
it with code.

# Are you leading any projects related to open science?

From the perspective of cultural evolution and cognitive science, I'm interested in why open source works, and the ways in which the products of open collaborations change as a function of iteration. As an advocate for open science practices, I conduct my research in a way that others can learn from, and have given talks and tutorials on how to use open source tools for open science.

# How do you see Mozilla advancing your work?

I want to get better at collaborating both for the sake of my own projects as well as figuring out where my skills would be the most beneficial to the open science community.

# What do you see as the opportunities for impact around open research at your university? Could you leverage this opportunity in a potential project?

Open research for behavioral sciences like psychology involves sharing data, experimental methods, and analysis techniques, largely through documentation and code. I know first hand of the need for students in my program and other behavioral sciences to learn computer programming practices that are common to computer scientists but are not taught in other departments, for example, learning a version control system.

# What do you think needs to change most immediately in scientific research?

It's not enough to make experimental methods and data available for others to use, in addition we should strive to make experimental methods extendable, and open scientists should engage in practices that can be shown to maximize reuse, largely at the hands of automation with code.

# What project in the field do you find most inspiring to further science and the web?

I'm interested in platforms for web based behavioral experiments like VolunteerScience and PsiTurk. These projects afford experiments never before possible involving large scale online interaction and collaboration. We are approaching a science of how the products of human collaboration change as a function of iteration.

# Why is the open web important to you?

I trust the open web because I believe it is engineered for success. In open cultures, progress can come from anyone and in any form.
